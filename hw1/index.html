		<h2>Problem 1</h2>
		<p>The main operation of rasterizing a triangle comes down to checking if a point lies within the triangle.
		In order to check this, I used the simple three-line equation from Lecture 2.</p>
		<p>To generate the triangle's bounding box, the function first finds the maximum and mimumum X and Y values 
		of the three input points. Then, it checks each of those points for interiority by running each through 
		the three-line equation. Therefore, it is exactly as efficient as one that checks every point within
		the bounding box.</p>
