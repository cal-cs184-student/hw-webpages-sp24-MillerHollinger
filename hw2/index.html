		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this homework, two topics were explored: first, I used de Casteljau's algorithm to render bezier lines, and then transitioned that technique into 3D to render a bezier-defined 3D object.
			Then, after I implemented area-weighted vertex normals, I wrote a variety of common mesh manipulation functions.
		</p>
		<i>Grader's Note: Tasks 1-6 completed. No extra credit attempted.</i>
		<h2>Part 1</h2>
		<p>
			De Casteljau's Algorithm is a surprisingly elegant algorithm used to create Bezier curves out of a set of control points connected by lines. The basic idea is that you reduce the set of control points down
			to a set of intermediary points by connecting the midpoints of the lines between the control points. As there are X points and X-1 lines, you therefore end up with one fewer point in the
			intermediate set than you had in the control set. Repeating this process until only one point remains yields a point on the curve. To construct the whole curve, the midpoints are, instead of being precisely
			in the center, instead interpolated towards one end or the other of the curve using a value, called t. Drawing every resulting point using all t-values from 0 to 1 yields a Bezier curve.
		</p>
		<p>Starting with the curve shown below, we can show this process for the t-value 0.5.</p>

		<p>The red point is the final calculated point, and is on the bezier curve. Repeating this process for values of t between 0 and 1 yields the entire curve.</p>
		<p>See another example below with an altered t-value and control points.</p>

		<h2>Part 2</h2>
		<p>
			When extended to 3D, de Casteljau's algorithm works by creating a second intermediate set of control points. Each row of control points is treated as an individual Bezier curve,
			interpolated in three dimensions instead of two. The resulting point from that Bezier curve is then used as a control point, alongside the points created by each other row,
			to create a column-wise Bezier curve. That curve is also interpolated across to find the location of the final point.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another change when switching to 3D is that the "t" value is exchanged for two values, u and v. 
			These indicate the ratio of the linear interpolation for the rows and columns respectively. They are each varied between 0 and 1 independently.
			Having a separate u and v allows for a surface to be created instead of simply a line, as for each point defined by a given u value, a bezier curve can be created by varying the v value.
			The same is true in reverse -- therefore, a 2D Bezier surface might be thought of as an infinite number of Bezier curves pressed against each other.

		<h2>Part 3</h2>
		<p>
			To implement the area-weighted vertex normals, I first created a loop that iterates through each halfedge leading into a point in a similar fashion to the provided printNeighborPositions() function. 
			At each step, two adjacent neighbors are found. These two neighbors are guaranteed to be two neighbors which form a face neighboring the third.
			Then, the normal of this face is calculated using the cross product.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the end, each of these calculated normals is summed, then finally normalized to get the resulting normal of the vertex itself. The result is the ability to make very smooth-looking objects, like
			the one shown below.

		<h2>Part 4</h2>
		<p>
			With operations such as flipping an edge, all that is really necessary is a clear idea of what the object will look like before and after the operation. I used the guide provided to us
			at <a href="http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf">http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2015content/misc/HalfedgeEdgeOpImplementationGuide.pdf</a>
			to get a visual understanding of what would change (and what would stay the same) after executing the edge flip operation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main issue I had to debug revolved around the outer neighbors, specifically the outer half-edges, and ensuring their values were set properly. Debugging came down to simply going back
			over the code I wrote with a fine-toothed comb and verifying each element was correct as shown on the chart. After doing so, I found and fixed the error, though it was truly like finding
			a needle in a haystack.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's some edge flipping action:
		</p>
		<img src="./image4.png">
		<p>After a few flips...</p>
		<img src="./image42.png">
		<p>And after many more flips.</p>
		<img src="./image43.png">
		<p>It makes an interesting pattern!</p>
		<img src="./image44.png">
		<h2>Part 5</h2>
		<p>
			The main difference between the edge split operation and the edge flip operation was the need to create additional mesh elements and set their values.
			Aside for that, it was essentially the same process as Part 4 — draw the input mesh, draw the output mesh, label each element, and meticulously set every element to its intended value.
			For the vertex, I  got the midpoint of the constituent vertices by averaging their positions and set the new vertex's position to that.
		</p>
		<p>
			Time for some edge splitting!
		</p>
		<img src="./image51.png">

			Let's split it in some places...

		</p>
		<img src="./image53.png">
		<p>
			And some more flips and splits for good measure.
		</p>
		<img src="./image54.png">
		<p>
			Debugging here was similar to Part 4, except that I realized I had to initialize the position of the new vertex — the first time I tried to split a vertex, it appeared at the default
			position of (0, 0, 0), which was very confusing! I uncovered another issue when I pressed Q to switch to smoothed mode: I'd forgotten to set the value of my new
			vertex's halfEdge(), so it segfaulted the program. Still, it was a quick and easy way to find out there was an issue!
		</p>
		<h2>Part 6</h2>
		<p>
			For loop subdivision, I followed the provided guide and made use of the isNew variable as well as the charts I'd drawn for my flip and split operations.
			The main bug I encountered revolved around juggling the value of newPosition -- specifically, finding the correct place in the code to set it, and what exactly to set it to.
			It became clear there was a problem because vertices kept appearing at (0, 0, 0) instead of at their intended position. I also ran into issues with over-flipping edges,
			which I resolved by changing the condition for when to flip an edge by trying several different conditions and checking the effect of each.
			The correct implementation required me to keep in mind both if an edge were new or old and also if its vertices were new or old.
		</p>
		<p>
			Subdivision tends to have a smoothing effect on objects, which makes sense because each step conducts a weighted average on each point. Additionally, it adds more
			vertices, which reduces the number of flat surfaces. Let's look at some examples:
		</p>
		<p>This pointy icosahedron smooths out, gradually becoming a ball.</p>
		<img src="./image61.png">
		<img src="./image62.png">
		<img src="./image63.png">
		<p>The torus also smooths out very well after a few iterations.</p>
		<img src="./image66.png">
		<img src="./image67.png">'
		<img src="./image68.png">
		<p>This bean, on the other hand, is already high-poly and barely changes shape when subdivided.</p>
		<img src="./image64.png">
		<img src="./image65.png">
		<p>
			Although the cube starts out symmetrical, a few subdivisions cause it to become asymmetrical, with opposite corners pulling together. 
			This is because of the way we weight the positions of neighboring points when
			subdividing: when placing a new vertex, the vertices touching an edge are weighted 3/8 each, while the other two face-adjacent vertices 
			are only weighted 1/8. Therefore, the central diagonal edge pulls its two vertices closer together over time, while the other two move
			less. This causes asymmetry.
		</p>
		<img src="./image69.png">
		<img src="./image610.png">
		<p>
			As the issue is an asymmetrical edge, the solution must be making edges symmetrical. So, to prevent this, we can simply split the six diagonal edges 
			to create a symmetrical "X" on each face:
		</p>
		<img src="./image611.png">
		<p>Now, the pulling effect is balanced in all directions, creating a symmetrical pillow-like cube after a few iterations.</p>
		<img src="./image612.png">
		<img src="./image613.png">
		<p>This concludes Homework 2.</p>
