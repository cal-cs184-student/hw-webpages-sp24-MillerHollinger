		<h2>Problem 1</h2>
		<p>
			De Casteljau's Algorithm is a surprisingly elegant algorithm used to create Bezier curves out of a set of control points connected by lines. The basic idea is that you reduce the set of control points down
			to a set of intermediary points by connecting the midpoints of the lines between the control points. As there are X points and X-1 lines, you therefore end up with one fewer point in the
			intermediate set than you had in the control set. Repeating this process until only one point remains yields a point on the curve. To construct the whole curve, the midpoints are, instead of being precisely
			in the center, are instead weighted towards one end or the other of the curve using a value, called t. Drawing every resulting point with a t-value from 0 to 1 yields a Bezier curve.
		</p>
		<p>Starting with the curve shown below, we can show this process for the t-value 0.5.</p>

		<p>The red point is the final calculated point, and is on the bezier curve. Repeating this process for values of t between 0 and 1 yields the entire curve.</p>
		<p>See another example below with an altered t-value and control points.</p>
